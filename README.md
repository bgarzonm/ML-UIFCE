# Customer Churn Prediction Project

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for Customer Churn Prediction project. The goal of this project was to develop a predictive model that can identify potential customer churn.

## Project Highlights

- Explored and analyzed the dataset.
- Preprocessed the data, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.
- Utilized various machine learning algorithms for classification, including:
  - XGBoost
  - Random Forest
  - Logistic Regression
- Employed deep learning.

## Repository Structure

- **data**: This directory contains the dataset used for the project.
- **features**: Jupyter notebooks used for EDA.
- **models**: Jupyter notebooks used for model training, and evaluation.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bgarzonm/ML-UIFCE.git

3. Navigate to the `models` or `features` directory to explore the Jupyter notebooks
4. Feel free to adapt the code and models for your own use case.

## Results

After training and evaluating the models, we achieved the following performance:

- XGBoost:
  - Accuracy: 0.99
  - F1-Score: 0.98

- Random Forest:
  - Accuracy: 0.98
  - F1-Score: 0.97

- Logistic Regression:
  - Accuracy: 0.89
  - F1-Score: 0.88


## Conclusion

The results from our models can help businesses identify customers at risk of churning and take proactive measures to retain them, ultimately improving customer retention and business profitability.
